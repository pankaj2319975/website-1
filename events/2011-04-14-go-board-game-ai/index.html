    <p>This Thursday, April 14th at 7PM in Dreese 264, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on open source artificial intelligence for the board game Go.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI&rsquo;s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>
