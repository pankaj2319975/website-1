 <p>On Tuesday May 19th, Embedded designer, musician, and ex-Imagineer Jamie Robertson will be giving a talk on embedded systems in the art and entertainment world.</p>

<p>Jamie recently collaborated with Mike Gordan, a member of the band Phish, to create an interactive multimedia installation which was part of the 2009 Boston Cyberarts Festival. For this project, he designed, built, and programmed a wireless, distributed, people-sensing system capable of playing sounds and controlling lights based on proximity to works of art. He will present an overview of this system as well as describe some other recent product designs for the music and pro audio industry.</p>

<p>The meeting will be at 7:30pm in Knowlton 250. Everyone is invited to come and there will be free pizza and pop.</p>

<p>Jamie holds a degree in Engineering Physics, was a director of Research &amp; Development for Walt Disney Imagineering for over 10 years, and has been involved in the design of numerous milestone music products such as the Linn9000 drum machine and the Synclavier digital music system. He currently lives in Boston, where he serves as a design consultant for embedded systems, and last year released two CDs of guitar music which he engineered and mixed himself.</p>
