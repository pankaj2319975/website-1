 <p>This Thursday, January 7th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we are doing a talk and demonstration on hacking wireless networks. There will be 3 parts to the discussion. First, Brian Swaney will be talking about the dangers of poor security. He will go over why wireless communication is inherently insecure, what types of attacks are possible on wireless networks, some techniques common people use to try and secure their networks, and why they ultimately fail. Alek Rollyson will then continue on and talk about the behind the scenes technicalities of the attacks that we will be presenting. He will go over some specific weaknesses in protocols used by wireless routers, how they might be exploited, and how to protect oneself. Finally, Michael Yanovich will show us how to use the aircrack-ng suite to actually perform the attacks. He will show how to exploit all the common mistakes users make in securing their network, all using the free, open source aircrack suite. We look forward to seeing you all there. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This presentation is for <em>educational</em> purposes only. Use of these techniques in a manner other than how they are presented may be in violation of state/federal law, and also totally uncool. We do not condone their use for illegal or nefarious purposes.</p>
