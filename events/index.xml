      <description>Commands that work together form the basis of *nix systems. You can take advantage of existing tools by making your own work well with others.
In this Talk we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss: - What makes a command line application &amp;ldquo;well-behaved&amp;rdquo; - Why you might want to use Python (and when you might not) - How you can use the click package to make your own CLIs
Demos and a tutorial are available for those that want to try it for themselves.</description>

      <description>The need for understanding complex technologies has never been greater—and never more poorly understood. Hiring managers often look for buzzphrase-compliant resumes that enumerate technologies and techniques. Technology users and integrators routinely use their tools to solve the wrong problems, leaving themselves bewildered by their surroundings. In a world where everyone is connected, this creates systemic vulnerability.
The computer expert firm Interhack was formed as a research group in 1997 and incorporated in 2000, helping people to stay in control of the technology, managing function, risk, and expense, as well as understanding the implications of technology and data in legal proceedings.</description>

      <description>This week, we&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about Ansible. Owned by RedHat, Ansible is used in industry for tasks such as configuration management or keeping servers synchronized with standardized settings. In the age of disposible systems (containers and virtual machines) configuration management tools such as Ansible are indispensible. What differentiates Ansible from other CM tools such as Puppet or Chef is that Ansible is agentless, and able to communicate to any device over regular old SSH!</description>

      <description>Want to write a web application? Better get familiar with JavaScript! JavaScript has long been the king of front-end. While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and you still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead?</description>

      <description>Daniel paradigm Thau will present Bedrock Linux, a Linux distribution composed of software from other, typically mutually exclusive distributions.
If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo’s portage, and ensure that software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux provides a means to achieve this.</description>

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;ve surely heard of the containerization sensation that&amp;rsquo;s sweeping the developer nation: Docker! Docker is a powerful tool that utilizes features of the Linux kernel to package applications in portable &amp;ldquo;images&amp;rdquo; and run them isolated from the host OS. In theory, an application should run just the same in production as it does in development—eliminating the &amp;ldquo;works on my machine&amp;rdquo; class of issue. In my talk, I will cover the basics of how to get up and running with Docker, how we use it at CoverMyMeds, as well as some of the issues we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered.</description>

Licensing is a key part of the open source community, and your choices are diverse. We will talk about licenses ranging from the copyleft to the copyright, the unlicense to the Apache license. We will discuss how you choose your license for a project and what implications your choice has, and more importantly what a lack of choosing a license means and how it affects the Open Source community.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
This Thursday, 2013/02/07 at 7pm in Dreese Labs 369, Hussain Frosh of Harris will be presenting an introduction to development for Android. This talk will assume that the user will be starting from scratch, with no prior knowledge of developing for Android. Java experience is encouraged, but not required for the scope of this talk.
We recommend bringing a laptop, as the goal for this presentation is to have all participants set up and comfortable with the development environment for Android.</description>

      <description>This Thursday at 7 pm, in Dreese Lab 369, Brian Swaney will teach us GIMP image editing techniques. The presentation will be interactive and encourage audience participation, so you should bring a laptop with GIMP already installed to follow along. Some techniques covered may include cloning/healing, layer masking, fine selections, and basic image transformations. Some more advanced techniques may be covered if time allows, just to show that GIMP can live up to the same standard as other editors whose names are withheld due to trademark licensing concerns, but no prior experience is required.</description>

Thursday, March 8th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266 Joel Friedly will present on a project he was working on for a class. For a lab in his Python class, he built a simple Bayes network-based text classifier to identify That&amp;rsquo;s What She Said jokes in conversation transcripts. This will be added to Jenni, the Open Source Club&amp;rsquo;s IRC bot, so that she can make jokes at appropriate times in conversation.</description>

      <description>This Thursday at 7:00PM, in Dreese Lab room 266, Brian Swaney will be teaching us the basics of GIMP image editing. This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to cloning/healing, layer masking, fine selections, and basic image transformations. To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as other proprietary and expensive image editors, some more advanced techniques may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary.</description>

Many of Ohio State&amp;rsquo;s web-based applications and services rely on this open source project for authentication of students and employees and to obtain information about those users for personalization or limiting access to authorized users.
Shibboleth is primarily based on an open standard called SAML that allows for authentication of users from multiple organizations to services running at different organizations, a security model called &amp;ldquo;federated identity&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Fanboys will often proclaim what they can do in a certain expensive proprietary image editor that shall not be named, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to demonstrate just the same things are do-able from another certain free, open source program. My claim is that GIMP is just as capable of making your pictures lie as any other mainstream image manipulation software.</description>

FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.</description>

Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for. Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI&amp;rsquo;s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</description>

GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it.</description>

I will will be covering things from as simply as handling basic data types to more advance things such as making system calls or making the most of the PSL (Python Standard Library).
This meeting will also attempt to cover a small comparison between the larger more known languages: Java and C++, and show how some things can be done easier and quicker than in Java or C++.</description>

      <description>This Thursday, at 7 pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Brian Swaney will be demonstrating use of the GIMP image editor. GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it.</description>

It might seem too easy and obvious to bother with in this day and age. We all know how to rip CD&amp;rsquo;s, collect and share music, and move it to our portables for on-the-go music. My server comes from an audiophile standpoint. Long story short, I used to sell expensive stereo equipment.</description>

We would like to spend the meeting debunking this myth and showing all of the options that one has in the open source gaming arena.</description>

      <description>Thursday February 11th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be discussing alternative open source window managers for Linux. A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface. In other words it creates a desktop environment for you to use on your screen. The big two desktop environments are KDE and Gnome, but we are going to discuss some lesser known alternatives to these two.</description>

      <description>This Thursday [3/5/09], brought to you by Alek Rollyson, we talked about certain important internet related topics. How does one go to work without leaving his house? How does one completely mask himself to the internet? How does one hide his traffic from even his own ISP? All of these are accomplished by what we discussed. Specifically we talked about (and covered to some extent):
 Internet privacy, the cute little paradox SSH Tunneling  How (and why) to use DD-WRT for a nice little SSH tunnel  Proxies: TOR, SOCKS, etc.</description>

He will go over why wireless communication is inherently insecure, what types of attacks are possible on wireless networks, some techniques common people use to try and secure their networks, and why they ultimately fail.</description>

The speaker will be Matthew Stanford, who is currently working on his masters degree over in the design department. You may think that design isn&amp;rsquo;t important, but I have learned from experience that your really awesome code will go unnoticed if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a nice interface to go with it. I urge you to come if you can because this is a very important presentation that will help everyone make their work more presentable.</description>

      <description>This past year, the Carmen team got a new program for all of us to use. The catch is, it sucks, and your instructors can hold your grade in the balance if you don&amp;rsquo;t play with their new toy1. The program is inappropriately called &amp;ldquo;Respondus LockDown Browser,&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be the next generation of &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; test taking. While I passionately despise those who earn their marks unduly by plagiarism/forgery/exam-shoulder-surfing, this program is invasive and outright stupid.</description>

      <description>This Thursday&amp;rsquo;s meeting (October 16th in Dreese Labs, room 266) will include a presentation on source control management. The main tool that will be used is Mercurial, however most of what is shown can be applied to many of the other source control management tools. When you are working by yourself on really small programs, like the ones you do in CSE 221,222,321, then you can get away with not using any source control tools.</description>

      <description>This Thursday (October 9th) in Dreese Labs room 266, I am presenting on Net Neutrality. See a summary of what I&amp;rsquo;m presenting below.
Key Points:
 Net Neutrality is a principle, that if passed into law would prevent internet service providers from using their control over your internet connection for anything other than serving you.  It prevents ISPs from blocking/degrading access to competitors&amp;rsquo; (or any) websites for commercial or political reasons.</description>

We apologize for the inconvenience, and a group of us are working hard on the issue, despite limitations such as not having physical access to our server. We expect to have the site fully functional by the end of this summer, possibly with some great new features for active members. We are planning a great number of projects this year (some of which may be aided by our server), more than we&amp;rsquo;ve had for a long time.</description>

Subtopics so far include bitkeeper, cvs, git, Google Code, Mercurial, svn, trac, and open discussion of any other source code management programs not yet mentioned that deserve recognition.</description>

      <description>We had our first meeting for the quarter in Dreese Labs room 266 at 7:00 pm. Meetings end whenever they end, with no specific time. No absolute topic was decided on, so we discussed a few random things, such as South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone streaming South Park online for free (where we legally watched a recent episode from Season 12, which does play in Linux without DRM hacks), Adobe creating a web-based free express (and watered down) version of Photoshop, we also spent a few minutes sharing our web-development views.</description>

      <description>Last week, we had a really good turnout and watched some demos of hacking the Nintendo Wii remote to create your own virtual 3-D environment in relative to your perspective, along with a few other slick multi-touch-screen interfaces, bordering on making keyboards obsolete. We had a really great turnout and are considering doing it in the future. More information is yet to come&amp;hellip; There is also some talk about hacking the new Eee, a $500 child-sized laptop similar to the OX (One Laptop per Child campaign) with Linux pre-installed that, for the price, has some pretty impressive hardware specs, and I might add it is very light-weight.</description>

Our guest speaker, Jim Muir, is a nuclear and mechanical engineering who had better write solid code, and this presentation could be volatile, so we can just let Scott Labs bear this one.</description>

This past summer, p0rn and pharmaceutical spammers had a field day, then our website got taken offline and we had to disable forums and comments. We have cleaned up some lingering spam comments, re-enabled the forum, and added a captcha requirement in order for anyone to log in, as well as a few other random things.</description>

We had a demo with the Hello World and spent a lot of the time playing with the emulator prototype. Because I feel this is a very interesting development, I personally will be working on creating some apps for the platform. In addition, Google has $10M in prizes for developers who create interesting new applications for this platform.</description>

      <description>The Open Source Club at The Ohio State University (OSSOSU) will be holding officer elections to represent us for the next (07-08) school year. The eligibility requirements for being an officer are that you are a student at Ohio State, and that you are a member of the club (have attended at least one meeting). Graduate and undergraduates are both equals in this matter.

      <description>We have two mailing lists: A discussion mailing list and an announcements-only mailing list. Announcements are sent to both so you will most likely want to subscribe only to one or the other. If you are in the department of CS&amp;amp;E at OSU you can also participate on the discussion list via the cse.opensource newsgroup:

      <description>&amp;hellip;atleast our mailing list has caught fire.
Who would have thought &amp;ldquo;Linux vs. Windows&amp;rdquo; would have drawn any attention? I just want to rehash a comment made during our latest meeting &amp;ldquo;This week in slashdot&amp;rdquo; where +5 points was awarded for mentioning that &amp;ldquo;the Internet is not a drug&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
I believe there was a joke in there, something about doing something for coke&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Net Neutrality Debate : 5 Oct 2006</title>

      <description>A dual perspective approach to the Net Neutrality debate. Think of it as driving on the highway and you can go 60mph for a regular rate, or 80mph at a more expensive rate. Everyone is in favor of being able to pay more to go faster, but net neutrality adds that the guy at 60 should be able to go everywhere that the guy at 80 can go without additional charges.</description>

      <description>Months ago I made the decision to use Microwiki as the base of our website, replacing the old HTML site that we had previously. At around the same time, Freegeek Columbus switched from MediaWiki - the software that drives Wikipedia - to Mircowiki, and they seemed happy enough. It seemed a good choice for us. I thought that we should use something small and simple. Microwiki, weighing in at just 163 kilobytes, is undoubtably small and simple.</description>
